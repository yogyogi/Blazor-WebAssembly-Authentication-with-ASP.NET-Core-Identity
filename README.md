Blazor WebAssembly apps can be secured with ASP.NET Core Identity. We can provide login and logout feature for users through Identity so that only authenticated users are allowed to access the Blazor WebAssembly app.The complete tutorial is provided at - <a href="https://www.yogihosting.com/blazor-webassembly-authentication-aspnet-core-identity/">Blazor WebAssembly Authentication with ASP.NET Core Identity</a>.

# Features
1. AuthServer -it’s a server app in ASP.NET Core MVC that will have ASP.NET Core Identity implemented in it. It will allow Blazor WebAssembly app to perform authentication feature by calling login endpoints. On successful login an Identity Cookie is stored for the client.
2. BWClient – it’s a client app in  Blazor WebAssembly. It’s a frontend app through which user can perform  authentication process. This client app calls the server app’s endpoints to perform login, login, registration and other tasks.

The whole working process is explained in the below image:
